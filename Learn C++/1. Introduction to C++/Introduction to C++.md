# C++

- General Purpose Programming Language
- Has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features
- Cross-platform language
- Used to develop OS, games, browsers, etc.

# Features of C++

- `Simple` :
    - Provides structured approach to break problem into parts
    - Provides rich library functions, data types, etc.
    - Allows procedural and functional approach to design flow of control

- `Portable` : Concept to carry instructions from one system to another
    - ***.cpp*** file contains source code which can be edited
    - ***.exe*** file contains application which can be executed
    - A written and compiled C++ program on one Operating System can be executed on other Operating Systems based on that one

- `Powerful and Fast` :
    - Wide variety of data types, functions, control statements, decision-making statements, etc.
    - Fast language due to less compilation time

- `Rich Library` :
    - C++ library is full of in-built functions
    - Contains almost all kinds of functionality a programmer needs in software development
    - Saves time and increases development speed

- `Platform Dependent` :
    - Programs can only be executed on that Operating System where it is compiled and developed
    - Programs can't run on any other Operating Systems

- `Mid-level programming language` :
    - Ability to do both low-level and high level programming

- `Structured programming language` :
    - Allows breaking program into parts using functions
    - Easy to understand and modify

- `Object-Oriented Programming Language` :
    - Makes development and maintenance easier
    - Follows concepts like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc.

- `Case Sensitive` :
    - Uppercase (capital) and Lowercase are different

- `Compiler-Based` :
    - Programs are compiled
    - Executable file is used to run it

- `Strongly-Typed Syntax-Based Programming Language` :
    - Follows rules and regulations strictly 

- `Pointers` :
    - Supports Pointers
    - Allows user to directly deal with memory and control programmer
    - Very suitable for low-level tasks and complicated projects
    - Increases execution speed by decreasing memory access overhead

- `Dynamic Memory Management` :
    - Supports dynamic memory allocation
    - Feature to free allocated memory via free() function
